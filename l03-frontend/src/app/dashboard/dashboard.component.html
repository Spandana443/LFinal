    <h3>Technical Aspects</h3>

      This project was developed using modern web development technologies:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Angular with standalone components for modularity and dynamic rendering.</li>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js with JWT-based authentication to secure routes.</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL for data persistence.</li>
        <li><strong>Charting Library:</strong> Chart.js for visualizing dynamic data.</li>
        <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> NGINX serves both the backend (on port 3000) and the frontend (on port 80).</li>
        <li><strong>Routing:</strong> SPA structure ensures seamless navigation.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      Accessibility features (ADA/WCAG principles) have been incorporated into the frontend to ensure usability
      for a broader audience. The application is fully decoupled, allowing flexibility for future enhancements.
